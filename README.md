## CFC Homework Assignment
This is a copy of the component I created as part of the application process for a Front End Developer position with CFC. A live version is hosted at [http://jm-search.surge.sh](http://jm-search.surge.sh). I chose to create this using React.

### Instructions
- Clone/download this repo to your local machine.
- In the project directory, `npm i` to install dependencies, then follow-up with `npm start` to view the component. Your browser should be opened automatically.

### Known Issues
- Hovering over a match and pressing `Enter` will not select the item.
- If you're getting a conflict because a different `eslint` version is being used, create a `.env` file in the root of this project and add `SKIP_PREFLIGHT_CHECK=true`.
